# Personal Portfolio

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build my new portfolio website because I wanted to make a SEO-friendly site with React. Next.js is a joy to work with and makes building perfomant websites a piece of cake.

- For the styling I haven't used any fancy CSS framework. I just used CSS-modules with SCSS.
- For the icons I have used the [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) package with the [feather](https://feathericons.com/) icon pack.
- Using [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for simple dark mode integration (no white flash, synced across tabs)
- The UI concept design was built with Figma, but was tailored to my needs during development.
- The data for the page currently resides in the `/data/data.js` file.

## Running the project yourself

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).




## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
